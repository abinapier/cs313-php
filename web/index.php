		<p><span>Hey there, I’m Abi.</span>
		I like making pretty things that make your life easier (aka. simple and beautiful sites and software). Being a developer wasn’t ever in my plan, but being a designer was, so it’s a little funny that my technical background is much more developer than designer. When I’m not programming away I’m probably making cookies, or burning off those cookies on a run. Thanks for checking out my work!
